## Introduction

The data that we obtained contains information regarding historical figures. We downloaded the data from Kaggle, but the data was collected by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about a year ago. The data is based off of metrics from many wikipedia pages and believe the variables in the dataframe can be used to extrapolate what makes a historical figure "popular" by Wikipedia standards. 
For our write-up, we chose to focus on the variables `full_name`, `birth_year`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `occupation`, `sex`, and `industry`. However, in our linear full model, we will select more than just these variables. By the end of our data analysis, we aim to derive the perfect combination of variables that lead to a high popularity index, which is recorded in the dataframe.

### Section 1- Introduction to the Data


```{r filter_NAs}
panth_mod <- na.omit(panth)

panth_mod %>%
  ncol()

panth_mod %>%
  nrow()
```

There are 17 variables and 10,279 observations (with all NAs removed in the new dataframe). Before removing the NAs, the full dataframe had 11,341 observations.

```{r men-and-women}
panth_mod %>%
  count(sex)
```

Based on the filtered dataframe, there are 1,427 women and 8,852 men that are considered historical figures.

### Section 3 - Linear Modeling

#### Create a linear model to estimate historical popularity index by sex, article languages, & domain

### Question 7

```{r estimating_popularity}
m_pop <- lm(historical_popularity_index ~ sex + domain + article_languages, data = panth_mod)
tidy(m_pop) %>%
  select(term, estimate)
```

The linear model, based on the output, is:

`(historical_popularity_index) = 17.769(intercept) + 1.647(sexMale) + 0.295(domainBusiness & Law) + 0.810(domainExploration) + 1.752(domainHumanities) + 1.151(domaintInstitutions) + 1.106(domainPublic Figure) + 1.029(domainScience & Technology) - 4.1446(domainSports) + 0.072(article_languages)`

### Question 9

```{r}
glance(m_pop)$r.squared
```

Based off of the `glance` code, we found that the R squared for the linear model `m_pop` is 56.18276% which means that this percentage is the variability of the data that can be explained by the linear model.

## Conclusion











### Question 2

#### Create a map showing the concentration of popular historical figures around the world

```{r Italy}
panth_mod %>%
  filter(country == "Italy") %>%
  filter(domain %in% c("Sports","Arts"))%>%
  ggplot(panth, mapping = aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = domain)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .4) +
  theme_grey() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of historical figures in Italy", subtitle = "Focusing on the Domains of Arts and Sports", x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude", color = "Domain")
```
