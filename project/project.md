### Section 1- Introduction to the Data

### Question 1

#### Filter out NA values and record the number of observations and variables

#### Make a new dataset to avoid overriding the original dataframe

#### Record how many of the historical figures are men and how many are women

    ## [1] 17

    ## [1] 10279

There are 17 variables and 10,279 observations (with all NAs removed in the new dataframe). Before removing the NAs, the full dataframe had 11,341 observations.

    ## # A tibble: 8 x 2
