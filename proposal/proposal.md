### Question

Using information from a variety of famous, historical figures, how have certain industries changed throughout history, from a global perspective?

### Data

The data that we obtained contains information regarding famous figures throughout history. The data came from <https://www.kaggle.com/mit/pantheon-project/data> which originated from The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about a year ago. The data is based off of wikipedia pages. We felt that this data is credible given that it originates from an institution like MIT. The variables within the data are as follows: `full_name`, `sex`, `birth_year`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `continent`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `occupation`, `industry`, `domain`, `article_langauges`, `page_views`, `average_views`, and `historical_popularity_index`.

For our question, we will be focusing on these particular variables: `full_name`, `birth_year`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `occupation`, and `industry`.
